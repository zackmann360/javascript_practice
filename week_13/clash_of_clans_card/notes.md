# Clash of Clans Card

## Description: 
This is a project that I found on dribbble. 

I thouhgt it was interesting that the character was larger than the card giving it a 3d effect.

This project tought me how to position images and make them larger than the container they are in.

## problems:
When I began working on this project I was trying to use utilty classes on everything and realized that it was getting complicated. There was tons of utilities that were only getting used once or twice. It felt like a better solution would be to make a few big components.

I decided to split the components up into three parts top, middle, and bottom. Top has the image pop out, middle has description, bottom has stats.

Instead of utilities I ended up with a few css properties.

## learned:
I learned how to scale an image to make it pop out of its container.

I learned that sometimes using utilities are not the correct way to solve a problem.

HTML: 
```
```

CSS:
```
transform: scale(115%);

```
